  Greeting: Aye
  Dialogue:
  - Aye
  - "Caught me a big one this mornin\u2019! Nearly pulled me straight into the water,
    it did! Aye, never had a fight like that before. Sun barely peekin\u2019 over
    the horizon, "
  - "mist rollin\u2019 off the waves, just me an\u2019 the sea\u2014peaceful, aye,
    \u2018til me line went tight. Not just tight\u2014snapped like a whip in me hands!"
  - "Rod bent near in half, reel screamin\u2019 like a banshee. I held on, braced
    me boots against the planks, but whatever beast was on the other end had other
    plans! \n"
  - "Next thing I know, I\u2019m skiddin\u2019 across the deck, belly first, draggin\u2019
    me nails against the wood! Nearly went overboard, swear on me own beard!"
  - "Rope burn on me hands, sweat in me eyes, but I wasn\u2019t lettin\u2019 go!
    Not this time! A tug. A stronger tug. Then\u2014splash! "
  - "A great tail, thick as a barrel, breaks the surface, sendin\u2019 up a spray
    like a storm\u2019s first wave."
  - "Coulda sworn I saw an eye, gleamin\u2019 like polished gold, starin\u2019 right
    at me. Then\u2014snap! Line went slack. Just like that. Gone. Vanished into the
    deep. "
  - "Sat there pantin\u2019 like a fool, hands shakin\u2019, heart racin\u2019. What
    was it? No ordinary fish, that\u2019s for sure. Some say the deep\u2019s got
    creatures older than the sea itself.\n"
  - "Aye\u2026 next time, I\u2019ll be ready."
